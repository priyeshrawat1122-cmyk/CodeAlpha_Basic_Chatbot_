CodeAlpha Task 4: Basic Chatbot

This project is a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python.
The chatbot interacts with users through the console and responds
to basic inputs such as "hello", "how are you", and "bye" with
predefined replies.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of 
if-elif conditions, loops, and functions for creating an 
interactive conversation system.

Key Concepts Used:
- if-elif statements
- functions
- loops
- input/output handling
